> This page provides an overview about the different codesystems that are available on the artifact page.

### Codesystems as simple stand-alone

Following a proposal for stand-alone codesystems to cover the three relevant aspects:

| Codesystem | Comment |
| --- | --- | 
| [verb](CodeSystem-verb.html) | Conformance verbs |
| [activity](CodeSystem-obligationAlone.html) | what to do|
| [data expectation](CodeSystem-dataExpectation.html) | what can happen with data |

### Codesystems in progress

Following the codesystems that are currently under "real" consideration:

| Codesystem | Comment |
| --- | --- | 
| [commented](CodeSystem-ObligationOrigCommented.html) | comments on the current obligation set |
| [proposed](CodeSystem-obligationProposed.html) | Frank is working on an ontology-like codesystem that combines the different requirements |

<!--
| [Rob's codesystem](CodeSystem-obligationRob.html) | Rob is working on a codesystem that is closely related to v2. |
